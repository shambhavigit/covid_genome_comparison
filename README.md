Comparison of whole genome sequences provides a highly detailed view of how organisms are related to each other at the genetic level.
SARS-CoV-2 is a member of subgenus Sarbecovirus (previously lineage b) in the family Coronaviridae, genus Betacoronavirus, and is closely related to SARS-CoV, which caused the SARS epidemic during 2003, and to SARS-related-CoVs (SARSr-CoVs) in horseshoe bats discovered in Hong Kong and mainland China. Whereas SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus were rapidly traced to their immediate animal sources (civet and dromedaries, respectively), the origin of SARS-CoV remains obscure. 

To elucidate the evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV-2, I have performed a genomic, phylogenetic analysis in relation to SARSr-CoVs from humans, bats, and pangolins using R programming.  

The findings here support the claims made in the recently published paper titled A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China where the authors state that the genome they have assembled is very closely related to the bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate SARSr-Ra-BatCoV RaTG13. The novel strain has indeed involved and changed since SARS-CoV was discovered in the year 2003. 

Phylogenetic analysis showed that the SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to that of SARSr-Ra-BatCoV RaTG13 followed by Pangolin-Cov and then Bat-SL-CoVZC45. 

Pangolin-CoV is the second closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 behind RaTG13 as stated in Probable Pangolin Origin of SARS-CoV-2 Associated with the COVID-19 Outbreak 

  This finding suggests a distinct evolutionary origin for SARS-CoV-2, possibly as a result of recombination. SARS-CoV-2 might be a recombinant virus, with its genome backbone evolved from Yunnan bat virusâ€“like SARSr-CoVs
